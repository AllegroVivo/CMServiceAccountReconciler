??? Danger "Advanced Setup"
    The advanced setup and configuration steps are generally not required if you are using the 
    pre-packaged release of this application, which can be found 
    [here, on the releases page](https://github.com/AllegroVivo/CMServiceAccountReconciler/releases).

    Please don't attempt the advanced setup unless you are comfortable with Python development and
    managing application dependencies. Improper setup may lead to application malfunction. ♥

    If you understand the risks and wish to proceed, please refer to the [Advanced Setup](setup.md)
    guide for detailed instructions.
